GREETINGS AND SALUTATIONS.
I WONDER, CAN YOU FOLLOW 
THE WHITE RABBIT?
REALLY? WELL, LOOK AT THE
TIME! HURRY OR HEADS
MAY ROLL!
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE, DUDE!




IT IS TOO LATE TO PLEDGE
INSANITY NOW.




YAY! I LOVE RABBITS!
THEY ARE SO FLUFFY!




WOW, YOUR MASTER REALLY DID
A NUMBER ON YOU, DIDN'T HE?
YOU'RE MAD AS A HATTER!



WONDERFUL! I KNEW YOU COULD
DO IT. NOW LET ME SHOW YOU
SOME REAL MAGIC.
AREN'T YOU JUST LOVELY?


COME ON! YOUR MAGIC 
AGAINST MY CANNON BLASTER.




I'LL TAKE MY SCIENCE OVER
YOUR MAGIC ANY DAY.




ARE YOU GOING TO PULL
A RABBIT OUT OF YOUR
WEIRD POINTY HAT?



I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF
YOUR CHILDISH TRICKS, DEAR.
TIME TO GROW UP.
