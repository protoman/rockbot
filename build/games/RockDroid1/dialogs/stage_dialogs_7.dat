IF YOU WANT TO REACH ME, 
YOU'LL HAVE TO AVOID
THE DEADLY TRAPS.
FOOL, YOU CAN'T ESCAPE.
I SHALL ENJOY SEEING YOU
PERISH HERE.
YOU CAN'T TRAP JUSTICE.
I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL
STOP YOU!



THESE LITTLE NUISANCES
WON'T PROTECT YOU FOR
MUCH LONGER.



IT'S A TRAP? OOPS, SORRY!
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
JUST TOYS.



POOR ROBOT MOUSE,
HE THINKS HE CAN TRAP 
A CAT.



VERY WELL, SO WE FINALLY
MEET. CONGRATULATIONS!
NOW, GET READY TO DIE.



THANKS! BUT NO THANKS.
I CAN'T DIE UNTIL ALL THE
EVIL BOTS ARE GONE!



DEAD OR ALIVE, YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.




NOT AGAIN! WHY DOES EVERY
BOT AROUND HERE HAS TO
BE SUCH A BULLY!



I HAVE A FEELING YOU ARE
ABOUT TO REGRET TOYING
WITH ME.
