I WONDER IF YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF SURVIVING THE SUN REALM.

THEN, THE DESERT'S DANGERS
SHALL FINISH YOU.

FLAME ONE, BANDAGE BOT!
YOUR LITTLE SAUNA IS
NOTHING I CAN'T TAKE!



CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
NO HEAT IS ENOUGH TO MELT
MY CERAMIC ARMOUR.



NICE! THIS IS JUST LIKE
GOING TO THE BEACH! 
PIECE OF CAKE.



YOUR BRAIN MUST HAVE
SLIPPED THROUGH YOUR
NOSE IF YOU THINK I'M NOT.



DO YOU KNOW OF THE 
CURSE PROTECTING MY
PHARAOH'S TOMB?
THEN COME AND I'LL SHOW 
YOU HOW POWERFULL THE
SUN GOD IS. 
DON'T KNOWN, DON'T CARE!
CURSES WON'T PROTECT YOU
FROM ME!



CURSES ARE INEXISTANT.
MYTHS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED
AS ANY THREAT.



CURSES ARE BAD AND BAD BOTS
ALWAYS LOSE! DID NOBODY
TOLD YOU THAT?



CAN WE STOP THE CHITCHAT
AND WRAP THIS UP? I DON'T
WANT TO BE TIED UP HERE.
