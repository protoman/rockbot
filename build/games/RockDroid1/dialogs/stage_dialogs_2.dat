YOU ARE BRAVE, BUT MY
FLOWER POWER WILL PUT
YOU IN A DEEP SLEEP!
YOU UGLY ROBOT!
MOTHER NATURE SHALL ALWAYS 
PREVAIL OVER TECHNOLOGY.
SORRY PRINCESS, BUT
NOT ON THE FIRST DATE.




I DO NOT BREATHE OR SLEEP.
YOUR POWERS ARE WASTED
ON ME.



BUT IT'S NOT TIME FOR MY
BEAUTY SLEEP YET! CAN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR YOU, THOUGH.



I'M ALLERGIC TO FLOWERS
SO IT'S BEST IF YOU JUST
DISSAPEAR.



YOU HURT MY CUTE FRIENDS.
I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!!

STOP TALKING AND DIE!


I'M NOT FOND OF FIGHTING
GIRLS. CAN'T YOU SURRENDER
INSTEAD?



WARNING, USE OF FORCE IS
ALLOWED IN CASE OF HOSTILE
ATTACK.



I DIDN'T MEAN TO, THEY
ATTACKED ME! MAYBE WE 
CAN TALK ABOUT THIS?



COULDN'T CARE LESS, SISTER.
THEY SHOULD KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO STAND IN MY WAY.
