IDIOTS! ANYONE WHO DARES
ENTER MY WATER DOMAIN
HAS TO PAY THE PRICE.
WHAT?! YOU MAGGOT!
LET'S HAVE US A LITTLE
CHAT ABOUT RESPECT.
CAN'T WE RUSH THIS?
MY CIRCUITS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE RUSTY.



NO MATTER HOW DEEP THE 
HOLE GOES, YOU CAN'T HIDE
FROM THE LAW.



PAY TO ENTER THE WATER?
THAT IS DUMB! AH, I SEE.
YOU'RE JUST A GOON!



LIKE I WOULD PAY ANYTHING
TO ENTER THIS SEWAGE DUMP.




YOU AGAIN? WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST DIE? YOU'RE FORCING ME
TO BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS!
THA'S IT! 
DIE! DIE! DIE!

OR MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE
YOURSELF UP?
JUST SAYING.



YOUR GUNS ARE INEFFECTIVE.
COME QUIETLY OR THERE WILL
BE TROUBLE.



GOSH, YOU'RE ANNOYING.
DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF
HEARING YOUR VOICE?



AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
A "BIG GUN"? DON'T MAKE
ME LAUGH.
