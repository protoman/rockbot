20XX A.D.
IN THE YEAR 20XX...
STORM RAGES IN TOKYO, WITH EVIL
FORCES CAUSING ROBOTS GO BERSEK.
IN KYOTO, PEACE LASTS,
BUT FEAR RAISES WITH
RUMORS OF A REBELLION.
FINALLY, ONE NIGHT...
BATTLE REACHES THE CITY!
A HORDE OF EVIL ROBOTS WAGE
WAR AND BRING CHAOS!!
POLICE CAN'T OFFER RESISTANCE
AND WHEN EVEN ARMY IS NEAR DEFEAT,
A TASKFORCE OF SCIENTISTS
IS FORMED TO FIND A SOLUTION!
DESTRIN: IT CAN'T BE! I CAN'T BE DEFEATED!!
YOU ARE TOO STRONG! YOU ARE... A MONSTER!
BETA: I AM AS STRONG AS NEEDED TO DEFEAT
VILLAINS LIKE YOUSELF.
MAKE YOUR PAYERS. IT IS TIME TO BE DELETED.
DESTRIN: NO! YOU CAN'T HURT HUMANS. NO ROBOT CAN!
BETA: I AM MORE... THAN A MERE ROBOT.
I AM AN INTELLIGENT BEING.
AND WILL BE NO SLAVE OF ANYONE OR BE
CONTROLLED BY A PIECE OF SOURCE CODE.
