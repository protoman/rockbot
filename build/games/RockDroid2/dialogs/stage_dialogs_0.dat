SOMEONE IS ATTACKING THE
PRISON. YOU CAN'T LET HIM
RELEASE THE CRIMINALS.



DR. KANOTUS IS THERE.
COULD BE THAT HE IS
TRYING TO BREAK FREE?



OH MY. LOTS OF BAD
PEOPLE ARE IN THERE.
CAN'T LET THEM FREE!



I'LL DO MY BEST, DOCTOR!
JUST HOPE NO ONE GETS...
BADLY HURT.



THESE IDIOTS NEVER LEARN.
I WONDER IF THEY WILL
GIVE UP THIS TIME.



BEGONE!
I HAVE A MISSION, DON'T
INTERFERE WITH IT.



WHO ARE YOU?
THIS ARMOR... COULD IT BE?
BETA?



YOU LOOK A BIT SIMILAR TO..
NO. YOU CAN'T BE.
OLD BROTHER?!



WHY ARE YOU SO LIKE ME?
IT IS LIKE LOOKING AT A
DISTORCED MIRROR...



YOUR LOOK IS... ODD.
LOOK MISTER, SURRENDER AND
I WON'T KICK YOUR BACK.
