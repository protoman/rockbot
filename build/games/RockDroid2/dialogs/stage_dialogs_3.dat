THE WIND CAN POWER THE
ENTIRE CITY. IT CAN EASILY
CRUSH YOU.



SEVERAL TRIED THAT.
THEY ARE ALL JUST NUMBERS
NOW. YOU WILL BE TOO.



SISTER, PLEASE!
DON'T USE NATURE POWER
AS IF WAS YOURS TO PLAY.



YOU WILL NEED MORE THAN
A BREEZE TO STOP ME.
LETS FIGHT!



WHAT A LOVELY ROBOT
YOU ARE. I LIKE THE RED
HAIR. GIVE ME IT!
