WELCOME TO SHANGRI-LA,
A LAND OF MYSTICAL POWERS
THAT YOU CAN'T BEAT.



I AM EQUIPPED WITH 
ANTI-MAGIC TECH.
SO, BRING IT ON!



I FOUGHT A BADDIE  THAT
HAD RABITTS IN HIS TOPHAD.
HE DIDN'T MADE IT.



I REMEMBER OF A MAGICAL
ENEMY. HE HAD NO LUCK.
YOU WON'T EITHER!



PUURRR. ALL THIS CHI IN
THE AIR MAKES ME VIBE.
