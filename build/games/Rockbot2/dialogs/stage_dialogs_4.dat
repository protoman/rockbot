SUN IS OUT, I WANT SOME,
IT'S NOT HARD, NOT FAR,
TO REACH THE BEACH.



AN ENEMY THAT LIKES
PUZZLES? I WILL SOLVE
THIS IN A SECOND.



I LOVE THE BEACH!
CAN YOU BE NICE AND 
PLAY FOOTVOLLEY?



THIS BEACH HAS A LOT
OF ROCKS IN MY WAY.




I DON'T LIKE THE HEAT
OF THIS PLACE. SO LETS
END THIS QUIKCLY?



YOU RESISTED THE HEAT,
BUT YOU STILL WILL BURN
WITH MY MAGIC FIRE.



I REMEBER FACING ONE
MAGE BEFORE. SORRY,
BUT NO LUCK.



SURE IT IS HOT HERE,
BUT I CAN SWIM IN THE
BEACH LATER TO REFRESH.



YOUR MAGIC WILL NEED
TO REACH THE TEMPERATURE OF
A SUN TO DAMAGE ME.



I AM NOT IN THE MOOD
TO PLAY WITH YOU MOUSE
ANYMORE.
