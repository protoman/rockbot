PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ANY
DOORS OPEN, OTHERWISE
ICE WILL MELT.



THIS IS NOT YOUR FACTORY.
YOU ARE A THIEF AND I AM
THE POLICEMAN.



DON'T WORRY.
I ONLY PLAN TO MELT YOU,
YOUR FROZEN BRAIN!



I WILL DESTROY IT ALL
IF YOU DON'T SURRENDER
RIGHT NOW.



YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE.
OH WAIT. YOU WILL!



YOU DESTROYED MY
ICE FACTORY. NOW ITS
TIME TO PAYBACK.



I JUST CRASHED A FEW TOYS
TO STOP A ROBBER IN THE
SHOP FOR KIDS.



I THINK YOU GET FOOL
WITH ALL THIS COLD.
SURRENDER!



YOU GAVE ME NO CHOISE.
FACE THE CONSEQUENCES
FOR YOUR ACTS.



REALLY? SORRY ABOUT THAT!
I WILL FIX IT AFTER BREAK
ONE MORE THING. YOU!
