WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE!
LET'S PLAY A GAME OF CRUSH
THE ROBOT. OOK!
YOU PIECE OF SCRAP! EEK!
I SHALL BRING YOU TO YOUR  
KNESS!
GAME? THIS ISN'T A GAME!
I WON'T LET YOU PLAY
WITH MY CITY.



GAMES ARE USELESS.
NO ANIMAL WILL STAND
IN MY WAY.



I'M GOOD AT GAMES! BUT,
IF I WIN, DO YOU PROMISE 
TO BEHAVE,  MISTER MONKEY?



I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR
GAMES, FLEABAG.




EEEK! EEK! OOK!
OOK! OOOOOK! 




SORRY FRIEND, BUT
I DON'T SPEAK "MONKEY".




LANGUAGE NOT RECOGNIZED.
DOES NOT COMPUTE.




OH, YOU ARE SO CUTE!
I ALMOST FELL SORRY FOR
HITTING YOU.



MEAW, MEAW, MEAW.
ARE WE DONE BEING SILLY?
