THIS GAME USES ORIGINAL CODE
AND ART ASSETS CREATED FROM
SCRATCH. ANY SIMILARITIES
ARE A WAY OF TRIBUTE
TO OLD GAMES OR A MISTAKE.
ROCKBOT AND UPPERLAND ARE NOT
RELATED TO ANY COMPANY OR GAMES.
GOOGLE REMOVED ROCKBOT DUE TO
USERS REPORTING IT AS
'IMPERSONATING' OTHER GAME.
-- WARNING HOMEBREW --
THIS IS A HOMEBREW GAME, MADE BY A FEW
PEOPLE, WITHOUT MONETARY GAINS AND
DURING FREE TIME FROM DAILY JOBS.
WE MAKE GAMES FOR YOU TO HAVE FUN, 
BUT STILL SOME PEOPLE HATE US.
DON'T BE A TROLL. DO NOT REPORT THE
APP BECAUSE IT LOOKS ALIKE.
